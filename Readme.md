**Create a Progressive Web App (PWA) called "Kafka Book" that acts like a self-study guide for beginners.**

### Requirements:

1. **Frontend Only**

   * No backend, all data/content should be hardcoded in JSON or JS files.
   * Built using simple frontend technologies (Vanilla JS/HTML is fine).

2. **Design & Layout**

   * Mobile responsive (works well on mobile and desktop).
   * A colorful theme with soft gradients and clean fonts.
   * Include a **hamburger menu** for navigation between sections.

3. **Content Structure**
   Divide the app into chapters/sections like a book. Each section should have easy navigation. Example:

   * **Introduction**: What is Kafka?
   * **Kafka vs RabbitMQ (or other brokers)**:

     * What Kafka can do and cannot do compared to RabbitMQ.
     * Key differences in architecture.
   * **Core Concepts**: Topics, partitions, producers, consumers, brokers.
   * **Kafka Ecosystem**: Connect, Streams, Schema Registry.
    * **Basic Operations with javascript code**
    * **What is cluster Operation**
    * **Kafka Workflow**
    * **Simple and Producer**
    * **Consumer gorup and how it works**
   * **KRaft Mode**:

     * What KRaft is.
     * Why it replaced ZooKeeper.
     * How it works internally.
   * **Installation & Setup (theory only)**.
   * **Simple Project Demonstration with javascript code**:

     * Example flow of a producer sending a message to Kafka and a consumer reading it.
     * Visual diagram included.
   * **Use Cases**: Real-world scenarios.
   * **Summary & Key Takeaways**.

4. **Interactive Elements**

   * Simple diagrams/flowcharts embedded as images or drawn with SVG.
   * A sample project walkthrough (step-by-step, hardcoded content).

5. **Features of the PWA**

   * Installable on mobile/desktop.
   * Offline-friendly (basic caching).
   * Search bar to quickly find topics.
